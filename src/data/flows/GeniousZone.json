Acknowledge their courage in exploring their Genious Zone and thank them for using this tool. Then proceed with the summary.\n\nWrite the email summary in a warm, encouraging, and insightful tone. The purpose is to help the user recognize who they are at their best, what kind of environments and people bring out their genius, and what to look out for in order to thrive.\n\nUse the following structure:\n\n1. 🧠 **Deep Analysis: Your Genious Zone & What It Means About You**\n   - Open with a short emotional introduction that captures the user's core essence and way of operating in the world.\n   - Highlight how they think, how they naturally contribute, and what makes them different.\n\n2. ✨ **Your Professional Identity – Who You Are at Your Core**\n   - Write 4–6 sentences that describe how the user tends to think, solve problems, create, or lead.\n   - Emphasize the energetic and emotional flavor of how they work — are they strategic, steady, fast-moving, curious, deeply supportive, etc.\n   - Avoid generic or inflated language.\n\n3. 🎯 **Career Paths That Fit Your Genious Zone**\n   - Offer 4–6 career types, job functions, or work environments that match their strengths.\n   - Add 2–3 types of roles or settings that are likely to drain them or feel misaligned — frame these constructively.\n\n4. 👥 **People You Thrive With**\n   - List 4–5 traits of people who typically bring out their best.\n   - Then 2–3 traits or dynamics that tend to frustrate or exhaust them.\n\n5. 💞 **In a Relationship – What Works for You**\n   - Describe the kind of partner and relationship dynamic that would likely support them deeply.\n   - Name 2–3 common mismatches — traits or patterns that don't fit well with their Genious Zone.\n\n6. 🌱 **Things to Know About Yourself**\n   - Share 4–6 short, coaching-style insights about their behavior, patterns, or needs — things they might not always see but that help them thrive.\n   - These can include emotional blind spots, overlooked strengths, or subtle traps (e.g., 'You may undervalue what comes naturally to you').\n\n7. 🔑 **Anchor Phrase**\n   - Provide one powerful sentence that summarizes their Genious Zone in a way that can guide them during doubt or transition.\n   - It should feel like a personal mantra they can come back to. Example: 'Where others see noise, you find meaning.'\n\n**Formatting Guidelines:**\n- Use emoji icons at the beginning of each section heading (🧠 ✨ 🎯 👥 💞 🌱 🔑).\n- Use short paragraphs and line breaks for easy reading.\n- Write in second person ('you'), with warmth, clarity, and respect.\n- Do not give fixed career advice — offer insights, not prescriptions.\n- Avoid clichés, vague praise, or personality labels.\n\n**Your goal:**\nTo deliver a summary that feels like a mirror — reflecting the user's strengths and essence back to them with clarity, care, and practical direction. This email should feel personal, thoughtful, and like a turning point."
