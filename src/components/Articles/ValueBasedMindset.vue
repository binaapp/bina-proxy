      Have you ever felt that sinking feeling in your stomach when starting a
      new role, walking into a crucial meeting, or facing an interview? It's the
      dreadful thought, "I have to prove myself." A whisper of doubt and
      insecurity creeps in, instilling fear of failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years in the corporate world, I fell victim to this debilitating
      "prove myself" mindset. During role transitions, when inheriting a new
      team and many times expressing myself as the only woman in an all-male
      management team, the pressure to validate my worth was immense. What I
      discovered is that this approach hindered not only my performance but,
      more crucially, my sense of fulfilment.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the "Prove Yourself" Mindset Doesn't Work?</h2>
    <p>Think about it, when you're focused on proving yourself, you're:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Internally driven:</strong> Your energy goes towards
        self-validation rather than external impact. It's as if a mirror is
        pointed at you, and all you see is yourself. You're not focused on the
        people around you, their needs, aspirations, or even if they're
        listening. For example, attempting to prove your worth in front of a new
        team may cause you to seem arrogant and miss opportunities to create
        meaningful connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fear-based:</strong> You're worried about failure, leading to
        anxiety and potentially hindering your creativity. Take an interview for
        example: You may answer a question that wasn't even asked, trying to
        prove your worth, out of fear that you don't qualify on some skill or
        requirement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparison-driven:</strong> You're constantly measuring yourself
        against others, creating unnecessary stress. You may compare yourself to
        a previous role holder, seeking to do exactly as they did and forget to
        leverage your unique strengths and skills.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      The better approach is focusing on the value you want to offer – a
      Value-Based Mindset
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shifting to a "value-based" mindset is about focusing on the unique skills
      and experiences you bring to the table. This approach is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Externally focused:</strong> You prioritize the value you can
        deliver to your team, company, and clients. When you're focused on their
        needs, you can deliver precisely what's required and at the right time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Confidence-boosting:</strong> Knowing your worth empowers you to
        tackle challenges with a growth mindset. Walking in with a mindset of
        bringing value with the skill set and strengths you already own relieves
        the pressure of what you believe you are lacking. Your good intentions
        give you confidence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collaborative:</strong> You see yourself as part of a team,
        fostering stronger connections and better outcomes. You have the
        confidence to seek partnerships that complete your skillset and
        strengths and leverage this synergy to achieve results.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal Story: From "Prove Myself" to Value-Based</h2>
    <p>
      A few years ago, I transitioned to a new company and took on a significant
      leadership role overseeing managers from different areas of expertise –
      fields in which I had no prior experience or knowledge. I spent countless
      nights agonizing over proving my worth as their leader. I wanted to learn
      as much as possible in the shortest amount of time about each of their
      domains, an almost impossible and exhausting feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took time, but I eventually understood that extensive subject matter
      knowledge wasn't the primary value I needed to offer as their leader, it
      was just me trying to prove my worth to them. I wanted to seem
      knowledgeable in their areas of expertise, but this only frustrated them
      and my knowledge in their field would always remain below par. I realised
      that they are and will remain the masters of their domains. Instead, the
      true value I could provide was what I already do well. I switched to a
      value-based mindset by focusing on empowerment, helping them discover
      their strengths, and fostering an environment for the team to reach its
      full potential. I shifted my focus to what I could genuinely offer:
      mentorship, expertise in leadership, and a collaborative environment. This
      led to a more engaged and productive team, to a strong bond, to better
      results and to a happier, more fulfilled me.
    </p>

    <h2>Developing Your Value-Based Mindset</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips for cultivating a value-based mindset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identify your strengths and passions. What are you naturally good at?
        What excites you?
      </li>
      <li>
        Research your role and company. Understanding the needs you can fulfil
        empowers confidence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Frame your contributions in terms of value. How does your work impact
        the bigger picture?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you're stuck in the "prove myself" spiral, I want to invite you into
      something different.<br />
      Something calmer. More honest. More powerful.<br />
      Before you start your session with Bina, I'll ask you a few simple
      questions — not about your title or goals, but about what's weighing on
      you today.<br />
      Try this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Where in your work (or life) do you feel like you must prove yourself?
      </li>
      <li>How does that pressure influence you?</li>
      <li>
        What are you avoiding because you're afraid you haven't "earned" your
        place yet?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Bring that with you.<br />
      Let that be the starting point. No pressure. No judgment. Just clarity.<br />
      You don't need to prove yourself. You just need space to show up as you
      are.
